				    robust test automation that is 1) highly abstracted and targetted at the
				    portion of the application being tests 2) has low maintenance costs.

The tests use sample pages that exist under the 'Pages' folder. Some tests use other support files
that exist under the 'SupportFiles' folder like XML files and bitmaps.

The project also uses an app.config file to provide global settings for the whole project.
